              This end user agreement (the "Agreement") should be read by you
              (the "User" or "you") in its entirety prior to your use of
              T-Starter's service or products. Be aware that this Agreement
              constitutes a legally binding agreement between you and T-Starter
              (referred to herein as "T-Starter", "us" or "we") which owns and
              operates the website on the Internet and the Service at
              app.tstarter.io (the "Service"). You consent to adhering to all
              the terms set forth in this Agreement when/if you are provided
              with an “I Agree” button and clicking on it.

            <h3>1. Grant of License</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>
                T-Starter grants the User a non-exclusive, personal,
                non-transferable right to use the Service on your personal
                computer or other device that accesses the Internet in order to
                access and use the services available and described on the
                app.tstarter.io website (the website and all its functionality
                together being the "Service"), subject to the terms and
                conditions contained herein.
              </li>
              <li>
                The Service is not for use by (i) minors and individuals under
                the age of 18 years, (ii) individuals who can be considered
                minors or under the age of majority adulthood in their specific
                jurisdiction(s) (iii) individuals accessing or using the Service
                from any jurisdiction in which it is illegal to do so. T-Starter
                does not have the ability to verify the legality of the Service
                in every jurisdiction, therefore it is entirely up to the User
                to determine whether or not their use of the Service is lawful.

                which are not expressly granted to the User hereunder and retain
                all rights, title and interest in and to the Service. You agree
                that you will be solely liable for any damage, costs or expenses
                arising out of or in connection with the commission by you of
                any Unauthorized Use. You shall notify T-Starter immediately
                upon becoming aware of the commission by any person of any
                Unauthorized Use and shall provide T-Starter with reasonable
                assistance with any investigations it conducts in light of the
                information provided by you in this respect.

              <li>
                Regardless of T-Starter's efforts, T-Starter makes no warranty
                that the service will be uninterrupted, timely or error-free, or
                that defects will be corrected.

            </ol>

            <p>
              You agree to the rules of the Service provided and described on
              the T-Starter.com website. T-Starter retains all authority over
              the issuing, maintenance, and closing of the Service. The decision
              of T-Starter's management, concerning any use of the Service, or
              dispute resolution, is final and shall not be open to review or
              appeal.
            </p>
            <h3>4. Your Representations and Warranties</h3>

                to you for any such loss;
              </li>
              <li>
                your use of the Service is at your sole option, discretion and
                risk;
              </li>

                you are solely responsible for any applicable taxes which may be

                your using the Service;
              </li>
              <li>
                the telecommunications networks, blockchain networks (such as
                Telos and Ethereum) and Internet access services required for
                you to access and use the Service are entirely beyond the
                control of T-Starter and T-Starter shall have no liability
                whatsoever for any outages, slowness, capacity constraints or
                other deficiencies affecting the same; and
              </li>
              <li>

              </li>

                You warrant that should you discover a bug or error that may
                lead to an exploit of the Service or other loss of funds from
                T-Starter, you have the responsibility to notify T-Starter at
                https://t.me/tstarterio in a timely manner. Furthermore, any
                attempt by you to use such a discovered exploit or bug for
                illicit financial gain is illegal and strictly prohibited under
                this Agreement. T-Starter reserves the right to prosecute to the
                fullest extent of the law anyone who exploits or attempts to
                exploit the Service in an unlawful manner. Such exploits or bugs
                should be disclosed in a responsible manner and in strict
                confidence with https://t.me/tstarterio and no other entity.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <h3>5. Prohibited Uses</h3>
            <p>
              Prior to your use of the Service and on an ongoing basis you
              represent, warrant, covenant and agree that:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                PERSONAL USE. The Service is intended solely for the User's
                personal use. The User is only allowed to use the Service for
                personal use, and may not create multiple accounts, including
                for the purpose of collusion and/or abuse of service.
              </li>
              <li>
                EXPLOITS &amp; BUGS. The Service is provided as is, and any
                exploitation of the Service or errors in program logic and/or
                code (bugs) constitutes a Prohibited Use and a material breach
                of this Agreement. Any funds the user may misappropriate in this
                manner pursuant to this clause shall be considered void and the
                immediate property of T-Starter, without limit.
              </li>
              <li>
                JURISDICTIONS. Persons located in or residents of the United
                States, North Korea, Iran, Venezuela or any other jurisdiction
                in which it is prohibited from using the Service (the
                ”Prohibited Jurisdictions”) are not permitted to make use of the
                Service. For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing restrictions
                on Service from Prohibited Jurisdictions applies equally to
                residents and citizens of other nations while located in a
                Prohibited Jurisdiction. Any attempt to circumvent the
                restrictions on usage by any persons located in a Prohibited
                Jurisdiction or Restricted Jurisdiction, is a breach of this
                Agreement. An attempt at circumvention includes, but is not
                limited to, manipulating the information used by T-Starter to
                identify your location and providing T-Starter with false or
                misleading information regarding your location or place of
                residence.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              Any and all monies (including cryptocurrencies) of a person
              located in a Prohibited Jurisdiction on the Service are VOID, and
              can be confiscated or may be returned to the person at T-Starter's
              sole discretion.
            </p>
            <h3>
              6. Know your Customer (“KYC”) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML)
              Policy
            </h3>
            <p>
              T-Starter is a permissionless and decentralised platform for
              token sales, swaps, and decentralized exchange. As a software
              development company, T-Starter has no role in enforcing KYC by
              default, however we do provide such tools for fundraising entities
              using T-Starter to enforce on their users, if the entities choose
              to do so. The use of KYC/AML tools on T-Starter by fundraising
              entities using the Service is completely at the discretion of said
              entities.
              <br /><br />
              Although T-Starter makes no warranty as to the merit, legality or
              juridical nature of any token (including whether or not it is
              considered a security or financial instrument under any applicable
              Securities Laws), token sale or fundraiser on top of T-Starter, we
              nonetheless understand the need of some token projects to require
              KYC/AML on their token sale participants.
              <br /><br />
              Therefore, and at the sole behest of fundraising entities and/or
              competent regulatory authorities:
              <br /><br />
              T-Starter reserves the right, at any time, to ask for any KYC
              documentation it deems necessary to determine the identity and
              location of a User. T-Starter reserves the right to restrict
              service and payment until identity is sufficiently determined.
              <br /><br />
              T-Starter further reserves the right to share submitted KYC
              information and documentation to 3rd parties to verify the
              authenticity of submitted information, and the end user (you)
              agree to this by using the Service.
              <br /><br /><br />
              T-Starter reserves the right to confiscate any and all funds that
              are found to be in violation of relevant and applicable anti-money
              laundering (AML) and countering terrorism financing (CFT) laws and
              regulations, and to cooperate with the competent authorities when
              and if necessary.
              <br /><br /><br />
              <strong>AML &amp; SANCTIONS COMPLIANCE.</strong>
              <br /><br />
              T-Starter expressly prohibits and rejects the use of the Service
              for any form of illicit activity, including money laundering,
              terrorist financing or trade sanctions violations, consistent with
              various jurisdictions' laws, regulations and norms. To that end,
              the Service is not offered to individuals or entities on any
              Politically Exposed Persons (PEP) lists, or subject to any United
              States, European Union, or other global sanctions or watch lists.
              By using the Service, end users represent and warrant that they
              are not on any such lists.
            </p>
            <h3>7. Breach</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Without prejudice to any other rights, if a User breaches in
                whole or in part any provision contained herein, T-Starter
                reserves the right to take such action as it sees fit, including
                terminating this Agreement or any other agreement in place with
                the User and/or taking legal action against such User.
              </li>
              <li>
                You agree to fully indemnify, defend and hold harmless T-Starter
                and its shareholders, directors, agents and employees from and
                against all claims, demands, liabilities, damages, losses, costs
                and expenses, including legal fees and any other charges
                whatsoever, howsoever caused, that may arise as a result of: (i)
                your breach of this Agreement, in whole or in part; (ii)
                violation by you of any law or any third party rights; and (iii)
                use by you of the Service.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <h3>8. Limitations and Liability</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Under no circumstances, including negligence, shall T-Starter be
                liable for any special, incidental, direct, indirect or
                consequential damages whatsoever (including, without limitation,
                damages for loss of business profits, business interruption,
                loss of business information, or any other pecuniary loss)
                arising out of the use (or misuse) of the Service even if
                T-Starter had prior knowledge of the possibility of such
                damages.
              </li>
              <li>
                Nothing in this Agreement shall exclude or limit T-Starter's
                liability for death or personal injury resulting from its
                negligence.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <h3>9. Disputes</h3>
            <p>
              If a User wishes to make a complaint, please contact T-Starter's
              customer service team at https://t.me/tstarterio. Should any dispute
              not be resolved to your satisfaction you may pursue remedies in
              the governing law jurisdiction set forth below.
            </p>
            <h3>10. Amendment</h3>
            <p>
              T-Starter reserves the right to update or modify this Agreement or
              any part thereof at any time or otherwise change the Service
              without notice and you will be bound by such amended Agreement
              upon posting. Therefore, we encourage you to check the terms and
              conditions contained in the version of the Agreement in force at
              such time. Your continued use of the Service shall be deemed to
              attest to your agreement to any amendments to the Agreement.
            </p>
            <h3>11. Governing Law</h3>
            <p>
              The Agreement and any matters relating hereto shall be governed
              by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the British
              Virgin Islands. You irrevocably agree that, subject as provided
              below, the courts of the British Virgin Islands shall have
              exclusive jurisdiction in relation to any claim, dispute or
              difference concerning the Agreement and any matter arising
              therefrom and irrevocably waive any right that it may have to
              object to an action being brought in those courts, or to claim
              that the action has been brought in an inconvenient forum, or that
              those courts do not have jurisdiction. Nothing in this clause
              shall limit the right of T-Starter to take proceedings against you
              in any other court of competent jurisdiction, nor shall the taking
              of proceedings in any one or more jurisdictions preclude the
              taking of proceedings in any other jurisdictions, whether
              concurrently or not, to the extent permitted by the law of such
              other jurisdiction.
            </p>
            <h3>12. Severability</h3>
            <p>
